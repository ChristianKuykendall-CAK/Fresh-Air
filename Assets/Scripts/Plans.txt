Make one player state the parent. The children are the different atacks by the player.

Make PlayerStates the parent class. Player normal will have normal punch as weapon. 
				    Player Gun will have a rifle that shoots bullets at a distance.
				    Player Vine will have a vine whip that can do medium range attack.

PlayerStates will have the script used to make character move and then all of the other scripts build off of the parent for their specific attributes.

Player Normal: normal punch animation, no weapon
Player Gun: Will use gun from first platformer game, different animation
Player Vine: Will be like gun except the bullet will be different and stop at a distance then use the animation to make it look like a vine whip.


OPTIONAL: Will be added in accordance with the time left to complete game.

TileSheets/sprites; Personally made which is hard to put time one, will be made on spot.

Enemies; like the one above it depends on time.

Rooms; made along with the progress of the game.

Options menu; Press a button on keyboard, use template from text adventure instead of making a new room.

Music; hopefully wont be as bad as the text adventure. make towards end.

Platform to attach to on wall when Vine state is activated; hopefully towards end.

Skill Tree; not likely. Would be neat.
